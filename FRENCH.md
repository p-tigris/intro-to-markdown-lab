# Basic French

French is one of the world's most widely spoken languages. Though not as large as other languages such as English and Spanish, it boasts a population of over 300 million speakers around the world. This is a brief tutorial on basic French words and phrases.

## Common Phrases

Many English speakers are familiar with common French phrases such as: 

* Bonjour ! *(Hello!)*
* Comment ça va ? *(How are you? or more literally, How's it going?)*
* S'il vous plaît *(Please)*
* Merci *(Thank you)*
* Au revoir ! *(Goodbye!)*

Other words and phrases you should know include:

* Je m'appelle... *(My name is...)*
* Maintenant *(Now)*
* Ce *(This)*
* Ne... pas *(Not)*
* Et *(And)*
* Ou *(Or)*
* Mais *(But)*
* Aussi *(Also)*
* Bien *(Good)*

## Common French Diacritics (accent marks)
French orthography consists of *diacritics*, more commonly referred to as accent marks, which change the pronunciation of certain letters, indicate that a word had an archaic spelling or pronunciation, or distinguishes between words that sound the same but have different meanings. Listed below are some common usage of these signs.

### Acute accent (é)
The acute accent, known in French as *accent aigu*, is only found on the letter **e**. The accent indicates that the e is pronounced as "ay."

***Examples:***
* écouter *(to listen)*
* école *(school)*
* café *(coffee)*

### Grave accent (à, è, ù)
The grave accent, known in French as *accent grave*, is found on the letters **a**, **e** and **u**. In the case of e, the accent signifies that the letter is pronounced as "eh," as in the word "get."

***Examples:***
* mère *(mother)*
* très *(very)*
* crème *(cream)*

In the case of a and u, the accent is used to distinguish between different words that sound the same but have different meanings.

***Examples:***
* à *(to)* vs. a *(has)*
* où *(where)* vs. ou *(or)*

### Cedilla (ç)

The cedilla, known in French as *cedille*, is used to indicate the **c** is meant to sound like an s, rather than a k. Used only when the c is followed by a, o or u.

***Examples:***
* Français *(French)*
* garçon *(boy)*
* déçu *(disappointed)*

## Pronouns and Conjugation
### Pronouns
French pronouns are very much like English pronouns, with differences in formality.

* Je *(I, 1st person singular)*
* Tu *(You, 2nd person singular, informal)*
* Il/Elle *(He/She, 3rd person singular)*
* Nous *(We, 1st person plural)*
* Vous *(You, 2nd person singular, formal; 2nd person plural*)
* Ils/Elles *(They, 3rd person plural)*

> Tip: In common French parlance, the word *nous* is considered very formal and is not commonly used. Instead, French speakers tend to use the word *on*, which has multiple meanings depending on context, but is the more common word used for "we." *On* follows the same conjugation as *il/elle*.

### Conjugation
French verbs tend to be varied in spelling depending on who is the subject. French verb infinitives (i.e. "to" + verb) end in *-er*, *-ir*, or *-re*, with different conjugations for each verb suffix. When conjugating, these suffixes are removed and other letters are placed. Below are the conjugations for present tense.

### -er
French regular verbs ending in -er, such as *travailler*, *parler* or *manger*, follow these conjugation rules:

* Je *(-e)*
* Tu *(-es)*
* Il/Elle *(-e)*
* Nous *(-ons)*
* Vous *(-ez)*
* Ils/Elles *(-ent)*

***Example:***

* Je parle *(I speak)*
* Tu parles *(You speak, singular informal)*
* Il/Elle *(He/She speaks)*
* Nous *(We speak)*
* Vous *(You speak, singular formal, plural )*
* Ils/Elles *(They speak)*

### -ir
French regular verbs ending in -ir, such as *finir*  and *choisir*, follow these conjugation rules:

* Je *(-is)*
* Tu *(-is)*
* Il/Elle *(-i)*
* Nous *(-issons)*
* Vous *(-issez)*
* Ils/Elles *(-issent)*

***Example:***

* Je choisis *(I choose)*
* Tu choisis *(You choose, singular informal)*
* Il/Elle choisi *(He/She chooses)*
* Nous choisissons *(We choose)*
* Vous choisissez *(You choose, singular formal, plural )*
* Ils/Elles choisissent *(They choose)*

### -re
French regular verbs ending in -re, such as *prendre*, *attendre* and *perdre*, follow these conjugation rules:

* Je *(-s)*
* Tu *(-s)*
* Il/Elle *(-)*
* Nous *(-ons)*
* Vous *(-ez)*
* Ils/Elles *(-ent)*

***Example:***

* Je perds *(I lose)*
* Tu perds *(You lose, singular informal)*
* Il/Elle perd *(He/She loses)*
* Nous perdons *(We lose)*
* Vous perdez *(You lose, singular formal, plural )*
* Ils/Elles perdent *(They lose)*

> Note for conjugation: Many French verbs do not follow these conjugation rules, and are therefore considered *irregular*. Common verbs include *avoir*, *être*, and *faire*.


## Grammatical Gender
The French language, unlike English, assigns gender to nouns. Therefore, the articles (the, a, an) for each noun will depend on its gender. A word such as *chien* (dog), which is masculine, will have *le* and *un* as its articles. A word like *vache* (cow), which is feminine, will have *la* and *une* as its articles. For plural nouns, the word will have *les* and *des* as its articles regardless of gender.

* Le chien *(The dog)*
* Un chien *(A dog)*
* La vache *(The cow)*
* Une vache *(A cow)*
* Les chiens *(The dogs)*
* Des chiens *(Dogs)*
* Les vaches *(The cows)*
* Des vaches *(Cows)*

**Putting all these concepts together, we can have passages such as:**

```
Bonjour ! Comment ça va ? Je m'appelle Mick. J'habite à New York. Je connais un peu le français. J'apprends le français maintenant et je l'adore. Ce n'est pas facile, mais vous pouvez l'apprendre aussi. Apprendre d'autres langues est très bien !

(Hello! How are you? My name is Mick. I live in New York. I know a little French. I'm learning French now and I love it. It's not easy, but you can learn it too. Learning other languages is very good!)
